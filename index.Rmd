# Introduction

## Introduction

### Motivation

- Explore *what* and *how much* adults are capable of learning in optimal conditions 
context.
- Explore relationship between production/perception in early stages of L2 acquisition
- Explore how L2 categories develop over time

*** pnotes

- This project is concerned with the acquisition of second language phonology. 

---

## Introduction 

### Rationale

>- Sequential language learning has phonetic consequences (e.g. 
Flege et al., 1997; Pallier et al., 1997; Sebastián-Gallés & Soto-Faraco, 1999; 
among many others)
- Non-native accent retained, often after years of exposure to (and use of) L2
- Infants become 'attuned' to L1 sounds within first year of life (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 2003; Kuhl et al., 1992)
- **Earlier is better**

---

## Introduction

### Late learners

>- L1/L2 cross-language interaction research suggests that native-like L2 ultimate 
attainment is difficult/uncommon
  - For both production/perception
  - Early sequential bilinguals (Pallier, Bosch, & Sebastián-Gallés, 1997; Sebastián-Gallés, Echeverría, & Bosch, 2005, among others)
- Grim outlook for most late learners (with exceptions) if native-like ultimate attainment is goal

### L2 learning models

- SLM
- L2LP

---

## Introduction

### Advanced late learners

>- Some late learners do appear to be native-like, at least in some respects (Bongaerts, 1999)
- Multiple factors appear to be correlated with L2 mastery (Bongaerts, 1999)
  - Exposure to native input
  - Motivation
  - Phonetic/perceptual training
- Research by Flege suggests that native-like abilities associated with...
  - AOA/AOL
  - LOR
  - Access to native input
  - **L1**/**L2 use**

>- Accurately acquiring the stop contrasts of a foreign language can significantly improve foreign accent ratings (Sundara, Polka, & Baum, 2006)

*** pnotes

- the task of the L2 learner of Spanish is to associate short-lag VOT with Spanish voiceless /p, t, k/, 
- and create a new category altogether for lead VOT associated with voiced /b, d,
g/ in order to produce and perceive the Spanish stop contrasts accurately 

---

## Introduction

### Language acquisition contexts (Batstone, 2002)

> - *communicative context*: L2 learners use the TL in order to exchange information
> - <BLUE>learning context</BLUE>: input generally comes from a teacher, with special emphasis placed on attention to form (e.g. traditional classroom)
> - **immersion context** (e.g. study abroad, domestic immersion)

*** pnotes

- CC = often immigrants that are confronted with the task of learning the majority language in their linguistic environment. 
- LC = The latter group typically consists of high school or college students taking a foreign language class for credit towards a diploma or a degree. 
- SA = naturalistic communicative context with the added benefit of explicit instruction in a learning context.
- Classroom shows advantages for XXX
- SA shows advantages for XXX
- There is little work on acquisition of L2 phonology as a function of context
- This research aims to fill this gap

---

## Introduction

### Traditional classroom 

- Advantages
- L2 phonology?
  - Zampini (1998, 2001)

### Study abroad

- Advantages
- L2 phonology
  - Stevens (20XX)

---

## Introduction

### Research Questions

>1. Do late learners produce and perceive the fine phonetic detail of Spanish stops after a short-term immersion program?
2. At what point during the learning process do late learners begin to acquire a new, 
language-specific phonetic system? How much exposure is necessary for the acquisition 
of L2 fine phonetic detail?
3. What is the nature of the representations of the L2 sounds acquired in this context?
4. What is the temporal relationship between production and perception with regard 
to category formation? 
5. Do LLs shift between language specific perceptual systems?
6. What is the role of input with regard to accurately and efficiently acquiring a novel 
speech sound?

*** pnotes

- week 0 assessment all participants reported using Spanish 0% of the time and English 100% 
- LLs used English minimally, roughly 13.5% of the time  
- LLs reported interacting with native speakers 40.5% of the time, and with more proficient NNS 65.5% of the time.
- the LL group received high amounts of L2 input (though not entirely native input), and reported minimal L1 use. The weekly percentages for each participant are available in Appendix A.0.4. The LL groups self assessments of listening, speaking, and overall ability improved with increased exposure to Spanish. For example, on the first day of the program the LLs rated their speaking abilities as a 2.7 out of 10. After the final assessment this rating had increased to 5.4 out of 10. Figure 2.1 displays a radar plot summarizing the assessment data over the course of the program.

**Effects of semantic processing on stop production**

---

## Background

- Semantic processing can affect production in L2 learners (Gustafson et al., 2013)
- Phonetic processing ('planning, programming, and execution of articulation') is susceptible to cross-linguistic interference because semantic processing activates L1 representations
- **Does semantic processing affect the production gains observed in the LL group?**

## Background

### Bilingual Language Modes (Grosjean, 1998)

>[...] state of activation of the bilingual's languages and language 
> processing mechanisms at a given point in time (Grosjean, 2002)

- Activation of languages increases/decreases as a function of communicative setting
  - Bilingual mode: both languages activated
  - Unilingual mode: one language activated
- Are perceptual expectations affected by language mode?

<p></p>

### Language set experiments

- 2AFC tasks given in different language environments
- Finding: bilinguals have two perceptual boundaries depending on language expectations

### Procedure

- Participants completed two 2AFC identification tasks
  - Session 1: Spanish - ba[fɾi]-pa[fɾi]
  - Session 2: English (24 hrs later) - ba[fɹi]-pa[fɹi]
- Language modes are induced via stimuli
- Practice session of 6 trials
- 10 repetitions (130 trials total) in 1 randomized block, ISI 500 ms
- Approximately 12 minutes

## Method

<div style="float:right">
  $log\frac{p}{1-p} = \alpha + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p$
</div>

### Analyses: GLMM

<p></p>

- Does perception of stops vary as a function of language/group?
  - ```response ~ language * group * VOT```

</br>

- Contrast coefficient slopes: $\frac{\beta_0}{\beta_{VOT}} \times -1$
- 50% crossover points: $(\beta_0 \div \beta_1 X_1) \times -1$

*** pnotes

- English-like stimuli produced an overall change in the log odds of voiceless responses (i.e. `pafri') of -0.56 ± 0.12 se (*z* = -4.61; p < 0.001)

---

## Summary of findings

### 2AFC (a)

- LLs group shifted their perceptual boundary after two weeks of exposure to Spanish (low L1 use/high TL use/input)
- Evidence for development of an L2-specific perceptual system/resetting of the perceptual boundary
- By the end of the 7-week immersion program, the perceptual boundary of the LL group was within the range of BI

### 2AFC (b)

- LL and BI groups had language-specific expectations for stop perception
- Both groups shifted their perceptual boundaries as a function of the language they thought they had heard
  - only difference between the stimuli was the realization of 'r'

*** pnotes

- replicates Gonz & Lotto 
  - with bilinguals (w/in subj design)
  - extends findings to L2 learners

## Background

> - Major theories of speech perception posit a relationship between perception and production
  - L1 acquisition (DRT, MT, GA) 
  - L2 acquisition (SLM, PAM-L2, NLM, L2LP)
- Chicken or the egg?
- **Perception precedes production in L2 learning**\*
  - Default assumption for most models
  - L2 phonetic segments are "[...] produced only as accurately as they are perceived" (Flege, 2003, p. 25).

## Overview

### Goals 

- Examine the production/perception relationship in adult L2 learners
  - Determine if there was a correlation between production gains and perceptual boundary shifts in LL group
  - Determine if perceptual learning preceded accurate production or *vice versa*

### Data

- Longitudinal production data and perception data analyzed together
  - Production: VOT from bilabial stops (7 sessions)
  - Perception: phoneme boundary from 2AFC (a) (8 sessions)

### Issues

- Data are unbalanced
- What is a production boundary?

---

## Method

<div style="float:right">
    $CO =  \frac{\beta_0}{\beta_{VOT}} \times -1$
</div>

### Metrics

- Phoneme boundaries
  - Production: mean VOT value for bilabial stops
  - Perception: crossover point from GLMM

### Analyses

1. Are production and perception related in L2 learners?
  - Correlation (descriptive)
2. In which modality does learning occur first?
  - 2 GLMs
  - Treatment coding (session 0 = reference)
  - Replicates production exp 1 and perception exp 1 with different DV
  - ```boundary ~ session```

*** pnotes

- production boundary different from initial state after session 4 (week 3)
- Perception boundary different from initial state after session 3 (week 2)
- corroborates Exp 1 from prod/perc
- suggests perceptual learning occurred before production gains for bilabial stops

- as production boundary decreases over time, so does the perceptual boundary

## Summary of findings

### Assessment

- LL group used English minimally and Spanish almost exclusively. 
- TL input mainly from native speakers or non-native speakers with high levels of proficiency in Spanish. 
- Listening, speaking, and overall abilities in Spanish improved over the course of the program.

### Production

- VOT values changed over course of program
  - Produce voiceless short-lag stops for bilabials and coronals 
  - Incorporate pre-voicing into their production of voiced stops
- Only /p, t/ within native range
- Production gains offset by semantic processing

---

## Summary of findings (cont.)

### Perception

- LLs modify their perception of stops after limited exposure to the TL by adopting language-specific perceptual strategies
- By the end of the program, LLs have language-specific expectations used for stop identification (double perceptual boundary)

### Production/perception interface

- Two modalities showed a decrease, or shift, in the phonetic category boundaries as exposure to and use of Spanish increased
- Perceptual boundary shifts occurred one session prior to the production boundary shifts
- Suggests that production and perception related in the beginning stages of L2 learning, and that phonetic learning is perceptually driven

---

## Discussion

### Longitudinal development of phonetic categories

- L2 phonetic category formation appears to occur **abruptly** and at an **early** stage of L2 learning, at least for stops. 
- The initial changes then continue gradually as exposure and use of the target language increase.

*** pnotes

- parallel findings in Zampini (1998) for /b, p/
  - also saw improvement in prod/perc over course of semester
  - not clear if due to L2 use/input or explicit instruction regarding artic.
- corroborates research by Stevens (2001) for /p, t, k/
  - improvement over course of SA program, longer stay = better results
  - pre/post test design, so not clear when learning occurs
- Corroborates Williams (1979) re perceptual boundary shifts
  - learning occurs at early stage in development of PR children

---

## Discussion

### Early L2 representations

- Evidence suggesting that adult learners can develop an L2 perceptual system and may be capable of switching between this newly developed system and that of their L1 in a manner similar to that of native bilinguals.
- Initial gains in early stages of L2 learning are **fragile**, particularly sensitive to cross-language interference
- Cross-language interference may diminish as proficiency in TL increases

*** pnotes

- Extends results of Gonzales & Lotto (2013) to L2 learners
- Corroborates findings from Gustafson (2013)
  - semantic processing affects phonetic processing
  - CLI may diminish as proficiency increases

---

## Discussion

### Learning context effects

- <blue>Traditional classroom</blue>
  - grammatical structure, morphosyntactic control
  - phonetic category development w/ explicit instruction
- **Study abroad</blue>**
  - oral proficiency, oral fluency, cognitive abilities
  - phonetic category development w/o explicit instruction

<p></p>

> - Domestic immersion
  - Same benefits as foreign immersion regarding L2 phonological acquisition
  - High input (different from SA?)
  - Advantage due to required TL use?

*** pnotes

- Best of both worlds?

---

## Discussion

### Second language acquisition and teaching

- TL use may be key in maximizing positive L2 outcomes related to accurate production and perception
- Present findings help inform language teachers regarding decisions related to balancing L1 and L2 use in the classroom

---

## Discussion

### Future research

- Phonetic drift?
- Extend to other speech segments
  - Spirantization (new allophonic distribution for L1 contrast)
  - Trills (altogether new phoneme)
- Replicate in L2 classroom and study abroad contexts
  - effects of L1/L2 use
  - relative importance of different types of TL input

---

## Conclusion

- The present investigation analyzed early second language learning in adults
- The studies undertaken for this work regarding the ongoing development of the
fine-phonetic detail of Spanish stop voicing add to our understanding of the 
acquisition of L2 phonology in adult learners
- The longitudinal data suggest that L2 phonetic category formation is abrupt, occurs at an early stage of development, and is perceptually driven. 
- Moreover, early L2 representations are fragile, and especially susceptible to cross-language interference.
