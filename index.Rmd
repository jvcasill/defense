# Introduction

---

## Introduction

### Motivation

- Explore *what* and *how much* adults are capable of learning in optimal conditions 
context.
- Explore relationship between production/perception in early stages of L2 acquisition
- Explore how L2 categories develop over time

*** pnotes

- This project is concerned with the acquisition of second language phonology. 

---

## Introduction 

### Rationale

>- Sequential language learning has phonetic consequences (e.g. 
Flege et al., 1997; Pallier et al., 1997; Sebastián-Gallés & Soto-Faraco, 1999; 
among many others)
- Non-native accent retained, often after years of exposure to (and use of) L2
- Infants become 'attuned' to L1 sounds within first year of life (Bosch & Sebastián-Gallés, 2003; Kuhl et al., 1992)
- **Earlier is better**

---

## Introduction

### Late learners

>- L1/L2 cross-language interaction research suggests that native-like L2 ultimate 
attainment is difficult/uncommon
  - For both production/perception
  - Early sequential bilinguals (Pallier, Bosch, & Sebastián-Gallés, 1997; Sebastián-Gallés, Echeverría, & Bosch, 2005, among others)
- Grim outlook for most late learners (with exceptions) if native-like ultimate attainment is goal

---

## Introduction

### Advanced late learners

>- Some late learners do appear to be native-like, at least in some respects (Bongaerts, 1999)
- Multiple factors appear to be correlated with L2 mastery (Bongaerts, 1999)
  - Exposure to native input
  - Motivation
  - Phonetic/perceptual training
- Research by Flege suggests that native-like abilities associated with...
  - AOA/AOL
  - LOR
  - Access to native input
  - **L1**/**L2 use**

>- Accurately acquiring the stop contrasts of a foreign language can significantly improve foreign accent ratings (Sundara, Polka, & Baum, 2006)

*** pnotes

- the task of the L2 learner of Spanish is to associate short-lag VOT with Spanish voiceless /p, t, k/, 
- and create a new category altogether for lead VOT associated with voiced /b, d,
g/ in order to produce and perceive the Spanish stop contrasts accurately 

---

## Introduction

### Language acquisition contexts (Batstone, 2002)

> - *communicative context*: L2 learners use the TL in order to exchange information
> - <BLUE>learning context</BLUE>: input generally comes from a teacher, with special emphasis placed on attention to form (e.g. traditional classroom)
> - **immersion context** (e.g. study abroad, domestic immersion)

*** pnotes

- CC = often immigrants that are confronted with the task of learning the majority language in their linguistic environment. 
- LC = The latter group typically consists of high school or college students taking a foreign language class for credit towards a diploma or a degree. 
- SA = naturalistic communicative context with the added benefit of explicit instruction in a learning context.
- Classroom shows advantages for XXX
- SA shows advantages for XXX
- There is little work on acquisition of L2 phonology as a function of context
- This research aims to fill this gap

## Introduction

### At-home, SA

- Zampini (1998, 2001)
- Stevens (20XX)

## Introduction

### Research Questions

>1. Do late learners produce and **perceive** the fine phonetic detail of Spanish stops after a short-term immersion program?
2. At what point during the learning process do late learners begin to acquire a new, 
language-specific phonetic system? How much exposure is necessary for the acquisition 
of L2 fine phonetic detail?
3. What is the nature of the representations of the L2 sounds acquired in this context?
4. What is the temporal relationship between production and perception with regard 
to category formation? 
5. Do LLs shift between language specific perceptual systems?
6. What is the role of input with regard to accurately and efficiently acquiring a novel 
speech sound?

<!-- 
L2 learners tend to produce VOT values somewhere between monolingual averages (e.g., Caramazza et al. 1973; Flege, 1987)
Early learners shift between language specific perceptual systems (Gonzales & Lotto, 2013)
LLs VOT production and perception can become more native-like in a 16 week semester (Zampini, 1998; 2001)
Production shifts occurred before perceptual boundary shifts.

*** pnotes

- week 0 assessment all participants reported using Spanish 0% of the time and English 100% 
- LLs used English minimally, roughly 13.5% of the time  
- LLs reported interacting with native speakers 40.5% of the time, and with more proficient NNS 65.5% of the time.
- the LL group received high amounts of L2 input (though not entirely native input), and reported minimal L1 use. The weekly percentages for each participant are available in Appendix A.0.4. The LL groups self assessments of listening, speaking, and overall ability improved with increased exposure to Spanish. For example, on the first day of the program the LLs rated their speaking abilities as a 2.7 out of 10. After the final assessment this rating had increased to 5.4 out of 10. Figure 2.1 displays a radar plot summarizing the assessment data over the course of the program.

**Effects of semantic processing on stop production**

---

## Background

- Semantic processing can affect production in L2 learners (Gustafson et al., 2013)
- Phonetic processing ('planning, programming, and execution of articulation') is susceptible to cross-linguistic interference because semantic processing activates L1 representations
- **Does semantic processing affect the production gains observed in the LL group?**

  - Do LLs develop a separate phonetic system for their L2, Spanish? 
  - If so, can they switch between Spanish and English systems depending  
  on the communicative context?

### Bilingual Language Modes (Grosjean, 1998)

>[...] state of activation of the bilingual's languages and language 
> processing mechanisms at a given point in time (Grosjean, 2002)

- Activation of languages increases/decreases as a function of communicative setting
  - Bilingual mode: both languages activated
  - Unilingual mode: one language activated
- Are perceptual expectations affected by language mode?

<p></p>

### Language set experiments

- 2AFC tasks given in different language environments
- Finding: bilinguals have two perceptual boundaries depending on language expectations

### Procedure

- Participants completed two 2AFC identification tasks
  - Session 1: Spanish - ba[fɾi]-pa[fɾi]
  - Session 2: English (24 hrs later) - ba[fɹi]-pa[fɹi]
- Language modes are induced via stimuli
- Practice session of 6 trials
- 10 repetitions (130 trials total) in 1 randomized block, ISI 500 ms
- Approximately 12 minutes

## Method

<div style="float:right">
  $log\frac{p}{1-p} = \alpha + \beta_1X_1 + \beta_2X_2 + ... + \beta_pX_p$
</div>

### Analyses: GLMM

<p></p>

- Does perception of stops vary as a function of language/group?
  - ```response ~ language * group * VOT```

</br>

- Contrast coefficient slopes: $\frac{\beta_0}{\beta_{VOT}} \times -1$
- 50% crossover points: $(\beta_0 \div \beta_1 X_1) \times -1$

*** pnotes

- English-like stimuli produced an overall change in the log odds of voiceless responses (i.e. `pafri') of -0.56 ± 0.12 se (*z* = -4.61; p < 0.001)
- The results of the second experiment showed that both the LL and the bilingual groups had language-specific expectations with regard to the perception of English and Spanish stops. In other words, both groups shifted their perceptual boundaries as a function of the language they thought they had heard, despite the fact that the only difference between the stimuli involved was the realization of `r'.

## Summary of findings

*** pnotes

The results of the first experiment revealed that the LL group did indeed shift their perceptual boundary with increased exposure to Spanish. The analyses suggested that after a mere two weeks of exposure, LLs identified the resynthesized stimuli differently from how they identified the same stimuli two weeks prior. This finding is taken as evidence of the development of an L2-specific perceptual system. In this case, the contrast involved, \textipa{/b/-/p/}, was one that already existed in their L1. Thus the learning that took place revolved around the resetting of the perceptual boundary between the stops in this contrast. The analyses found that by the end of the 7-week immersion program, the perceptual boundary of the LL group was within the range of the control group of simultaneous bilinguals.

The results of the second experiment showed that both the LL and the bilingual groups had language-specific expectations with regard to the perception of English and Spanish stops. In other words, both groups shifted their perceptual boundaries as a function of the language they thought they had heard, despite the fact that the only difference between the stimuli involved was the realization of `r'.
